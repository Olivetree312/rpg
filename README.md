This project is an early-stage **RPG-style C++ program** centered around an anime-inspired protagonist. It was created as part of **CMPE 126** to demonstrate **object-oriented programming concepts**, particularly **classes, inheritance, and polymorphic behavior**.

While the project does **not currently run as a complete game**, it serves as a structural and conceptual foundation that I plan to expand into a fully functional RPG in the future.
The goal of this project is to model RPG-style entities using C++ classes, with an emphasis on:

- Clear class hierarchies  
- Inheritance and shared behavior  
- Encapsulation of attributes and methods  
- Extensibility for future gameplay features  

The code focuses on **design and structure rather than execution**, reflecting its role as a learning and planning project rather than a finished product.
## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Base and derived classes
  - Virtual functions (where applicable)
  - Reusable and extensible class design

- **Algorithms & Data Structures (Course Context)**
  - Object-based data organization
  - Preparation for future use of containers (lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
  - Design choices that support scalability and maintainability
